WalkersGuide-Android
===================

WalkersGuide is a navigation aid based on OpenStreetMap data. It's designed especially but not
exclusively for visual impaired people. It's main purpose is to calculate routes for walkers
including public transportation. More about this project at http://walkersguide.org.

The project consists of two parts:
1. The server holds the OpenStreetMap data and calculates routes based on given start and
destination. It also provides an interface to query nearby points of interest.
2. The client sends start and destination points to the server. After calculation the received route
is presented to the user.

This repository holds the client application. It's written in Java and supports the Android
operating system since version 4.0. The application is fully accessible with Android's screen reader
Talkback.
